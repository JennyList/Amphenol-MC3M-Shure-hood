# A 3D-printable hood for the Amphenol MC3M connector on Shure Unidyne III microphones

I have a pair of vintage Shure microphones I've never used, because they have an unobtanium Amphenol MC3F socket and I have no plug.

I've made a plug of sorts, carefully picking from my stock of crimp-on cable terminations some that are only 0.1mm wider than an XLR pin. They fit the MC3F very well with no extra force needed. This is the cover for that plug. It should be printable without supports, then it should be a snug fit on the end of the microphone. The two halves slife together, and a small cable tie holds them together. I put another tie on the outer of the cable inside the hood, as a strain relief.

Take care to pick your pins so they do not put undue strain on the socket.
